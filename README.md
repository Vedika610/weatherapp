The weather forecast web application allows users to search for city weather details using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times, along with a 15-day weather forecast. The app dynamically updates the background image based on the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy). Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a visually engaging and interactive user experience.
